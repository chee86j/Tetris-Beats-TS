# React + TypeScript + Vanilla CSS + Vite

Modern Tetris Clone Built with React, TypeScript, Vanilla CSS and Vite.
Experience the magic where blocks, music, and visuals unite to create a symphony of entertainment.

This app served as an excellent learning opportunity for me to delve into TypeScript. By incorporating
TypeScript into the project, I gained hands-on experience in leveraging its features to catch type-related
errors early in the development process, leading to more reliable and robust code. TypeScript's strict type
checking empowered me to write more organized and predictable code, enhancing overall development efficiency
and making the project more maintainable in the long run.
